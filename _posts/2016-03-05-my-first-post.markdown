Developing an organized hiring process is an essential aspect of successful recruitment. By establishing a thorough hiring process, you’ll ensure that all of your candidates are evaluated using the same criteria, and you’ll be less susceptible to make impulse hiring decisions.

1. Customize Your Stages
After you create a job opening, you have to know how you’re going to evaluate candidates. The resume review is a given, but what comes after that? An assessment test? A work sample? A phone interview? In Recruiterbox, you can tailor your stages to the hiring process that works best for you.



Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
2. Collaborate With Colleagues
Another thing you can do in Recruiterbox is assign stage coordinators and interviewers. Collaboration is another important aspect of the hiring process. Our colleagues help us to check our biases, lighten our load and make us aware of important candidate qualities that we may have previously ignored.
